## General Info

This is an educational exercise to understand how to do a simple CRUD with react.js using axios and json-server. We can create a task that we can read, edit and delete, all of them with UX validations. Also you can search a task that it's already created.

### UI Design

I was looking for a simple design imitating a notebook sheet.
